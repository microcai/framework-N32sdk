    2/TIM1 is configured as Slave Timer for an external Trigger connected
     to TIM1 TI2 pin (TIM1 CH2 configured as input pin):
     - The TIM1 TI2FP2 is used as Trigger Input
     - Rising edge is used to start and stop the TIM1: Gated Mode.

    3/TIM2 is slave for TIM1
     - Toggle Mode is used
     - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM1 enable event).

    4/TIM3 is slave for TIM2,

     - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 enable event).

    * For N32G430 devices:
      The TIMxCLK is fixed to 64 MHZ, the Prescaler is equal to 3 so the TIMx clock
      counter is equal to 16 MHz.
      The Two Timers are running at:
      TIMx frequency = TIMx clock counter/ 2*(TIMx_Period + 1) = 108KHz.

    The starts and stops of the TIM1 counters are controlled by the
    external trigger.
    The TIM2 starts and stops are controlled by the TIM1, and the TIM3
    starts and stops are controlled by the TIM2.
