     The external signal is connected to GPTIM_CH2 pin (PA.07),
     The Rising edge is used as active edge,
     The One Pulse signal is output on GPTIM_CH1 pin (PA.06)
     The Pulse defines the delay value
     The (Period -  Pulse) defines the One Pulse value.
     TIM3CLK = SystemCoreClock, we want to get TIM3 counter clock at 12.8 MHz:
     - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
     The Autoreload value is 65535 (GPTIM->AR), so the maximum frequency value
     to trigger the GPTIM input is 12800000/65535 = 1953HZ

     The Pulse defines the delay value, the delay value is fixed
     to 639.96 us:
     delay =  CCDAT1/GPTIM counter clock = 1.28ms.
     The (Period - Pulse) defines the One Pulse value,
     the pulse value is fixed to 1.92 ms:
     One Pulse value = (Period - Pulse) / GPTIM counter clock = 3.84 ms.
