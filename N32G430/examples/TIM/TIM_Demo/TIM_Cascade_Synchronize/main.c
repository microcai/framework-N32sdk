     - PWM Mode is used

     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).
     - The TIM3 Update event is used as Trigger Output.

      3/TIM4 is slave for TIM3,
     - PWM Mode is used
